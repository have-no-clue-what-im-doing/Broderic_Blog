    <div class="content"> <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Broderic. Born in the 20th centurary; participating in the 21st. As of right now I attend the University of Cincinnati and am pursuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. The second being I want to also to document any projects I&rsquo;m working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don&rsquo;t think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.</p>

<p>This was my first true IT job. This was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory &amp; Google Admin
<ul>
<li>Resetting passwords, adding and removing users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBTS
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly</li>
<li>Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meraki
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Resetting &amp; setting up mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:</p>
