<h4 id="catholic-charities-southwestern-ohio---it-supppot-co-op">Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Supppot Co-op</h4>
<p><em>October 2021 - February 2022</em></p>
<p>This was my first true IT job. It was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory &amp; Google Admin
<ul>
<li>Resetting passwords, adding and removing users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBTS
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly</li>
<li>Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meraki
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Resetting &amp; setting up mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
<ul>
<li>A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="university-of-cincinnati-early-it-summer-camp---teaching-assistant-intern">University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern</h4>
<p><em>June 2020</em></p>
<p>I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
<h4 id="cpr-cell-phone-repair---repair-technician">CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician</h4>
<p><em>November 2018 - May 2019</em></p>
<p>An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I&rsquo;d just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not only was it easy to mess up the repair, but this was also someone else&rsquo;s phone I was repairing. So, if anything went wrong I&rsquo;d have to let them know and then deal with an angry customer and boss. Luckily that only ever happened once.</p>

<h2 id="interests--goals">Interests &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>My top interest is definitely cybersecurity. Specifically pentesting. I want to start competing in CTF&rsquo;s and start working my way to becoming a professional pentester. Obviously this isn&rsquo;t easy in any way. This would be way easier if I&rsquo;d gone for a CS / SE degree. I&rsquo;m not the most interested in math and theory though so I still think I made the right choice, it&rsquo;ll just be more of an up hill journey. And yes, I am aware there can be a lot of math involved in hacking, just depends on what you&rsquo;re hacking. Another issue I have is that I&rsquo;m not really much of a programmer right now. I will say I am familiar with the fundamentals of programming. Functions, variables, booleans, if else statements, loops, etc. I have experience using Python, Bash, and Powershell. Certainly not enough though, and that is something I need to work on. Once I have a better understanding of scripting languages I&rsquo;ll start working my way toward lower level programming languages like C and C++. The problem with all of this though is that it will take time. Like a lot of time. I can&rsquo;t just graduate with an IT degree and come out with a pentesting job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided probably the best and most practical way of doing this is to just work as a SysAdmin / Security Analyst / Network Engineer / Whatever and just studying all of this on the side. I&rsquo;d say the best method os studying would be CTF&rsquo;s and certs and just programming in general. My plan is to obtain the following certs in this order within the next 5 years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security+</li>
<li>Linux+</li>
<li>CYSA+</li>
<li>Pentest+</li>
<li>OSCP</li>
</ul>
<p>About to start studying for the Security+ Should take me about a month to complete.</p>
<p>I already have a decent amount of experience with Linux, use it for a lot of IT classes, but I want to really have an in-depth understanding of it. Think Linux+ should probably take me 2-3 months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the CYSA+ is pretty difficult. Think it&rsquo;d probably take me 4-8 months. Want to take this before the Pentest+ as I&rsquo;ve read it makes taking the Pentest+ much easier.</p>
<p>Pentest+ will probably take another 4-8 months. I believe after passing all four of those certs, it&rsquo;ll make studying for the OSCP a little bit easier.</p>
<p>I think the OSCP will probably take 8-12 months to complete.</p>
<p>Of course all these time estimates are kind of arbitrary. I honestly have no clue how long it&rsquo;ll take me to complete any of these certs. Many factors go into how long it can take someone complete a cert. A bunch of life stuff can get in the way, shoving certs to the bottom of priorities. Hopefully within the next five years or so I&rsquo;ll have most of these completed.</p>
<p>My thoughts on certifications is that they are definitely not the end all be all. I think it&rsquo;s more important if you really learn and understand the material you study for than to just pass. Another thing with certs is that their reputation can change very quickly. Say maybe in a couple years the OSCP sucks for whatever reason and isn&rsquo;t as reputible as it once was. I may just take it anyways because I know I&rsquo;ll learn a ton and that&rsquo;s what truly matters. When I was studying for the Network+ exam I read Mike Meyer&rsquo;s textbook front to back and took notes. By the end of reading the entire thing I had learned a lot about networking. I think part of it is that it forces you to memorize so much, and with these exams you can&rsquo;t just get by with memorization. You need to understand the actual concepts as well. This combination of memorizing and understanding concepts and topics really helps with learning new material.</p>
<p>This list isn&rsquo;t final either. Maybe I decide to take the eJPT or CEH instead. Doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me. I like certifications because for me it&rsquo;s a great method for me to learn new material. Having to spend $200+ per exam is also a really great motivator to make sure you pass on your first try. It forces you to study in a very efficient manner.</p>
<p>The end goal is definitely pentester, but goals can change. Maybe I&rsquo;m content with being a SysAdmin or something. Two other fields I wouldn&rsquo;t mind participating in are malware analysis and digital forensics. As with pentesting, these are two are both way way up there in the whole IT heirarchy. Overall, I don&rsquo;t think it matters too much what I&rsquo;m learning. The most important thing is to make sure I&rsquo;m always learning in some way. Whether that be with my job, certs, CTF&rsquo;s ect. The worst thing you can do in the IT field is stop learning. Eventually that will catch up to you and you won&rsquo;t have a job.</p>
