<h2 id="previous-it-experience">Previous IT Experience:</h2>
<h4 id="catholic-charities-southwestern-ohio---it-support-co-op">Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Support Co-op</h4>
<p><em>October 2021 - February 2022</em></p>
<p>An entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory &amp; Google Admin
<ul>
<li>Resetting passwords, adding and removing users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBTS
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly</li>
<li>Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meraki
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Resetting &amp; setting up mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
<ul>
<li>A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="university-of-cincinnati-early-it-summer-camp---teaching-assistant-intern">University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern</h4>
<p><em>June 2020</em></p>
<p>I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
<h4 id="cpr-cell-phone-repair---repair-technician">CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician</h4>
<p><em>November 2018 - May 2019</em></p>
<p>An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I&rsquo;d just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>University of Cincinnati <br />
2019 - 2024 <br />
B.S. in Information Technology <br />
Concentration on cybersecurity &amp; networking/systems</p>

<h2 id="interests--goals">Interests &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>My top interest is definitely cybersecurity. Specifically pentesting. The problem is I am nowhere near qualified to work as a professional pentester. The plan I&rsquo;ve come up with focuses on three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certifications</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>CTF</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="certifications">Certifications</h4>
<p>I want to work my way up to eventually obtaining the OSCP. The plan is to get these certs in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security+</li>
<li>Linux+</li>
<li>CYSA+</li>
<li>Pentest+</li>
<li>OSCP</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>
<p>Think the most straightforward way of learning programming is to just program. Reading about programming can help, but it won&rsquo;t actually get me anywhere. Need to start with simple projects and then work my up to more complex projects. Also have to learn both low level languages and scripting languages.</p>
<p>For Scripting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Javascript/Node.js</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
<li>Bash</li>
</ul>
<p>And for low level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
</ul>
<p>I think learning C &amp; Python first should be a good starting point. Especially C. I can kind of learn all the scripting languages together, but I think it&rsquo;s important to make sure I have a good understanding of C before branching off into other low level languages. The reason being a lot of other languages are written in C, and Assembly is I think a little too low level to start out with.</p>
<h4 id="ctf">CTF</h4>
<p>Once I&rsquo;ve become decent at working my way through a Linux terminal and can program a bit I&rsquo;ll start competing in CTF&rsquo;s. Start going on <a href="https://ctftime.org" target="_blank">ctftime.org</a> and work my up from easy to more challenging competitions. Also wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to practice with <a href="https://hackthebox.com" target="_blank">hackthebox</a> and <a href="https://tryhackme.com" target="_blank">tryhackme</a> as well.</p>
