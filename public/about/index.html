<h2 id="it-experience">IT Experience:</h2>
<h4 id="current-job---it-support-specialist-for-a-warehouse-of-200-people">Current Job - IT Support Specialist for a warehouse of 200+ people</h4>
<p><em>July 2022 - Present</em></p>
<p>I currently work for a warehouse that operates as the number one seller on Amazon. I help manage, maintain, and troubleshoot over 100 printers and computers.</p>
<p>After a year of working here I am no longer afraid of the scissor lift!</p>
<h4 id="charity-place---it-support-co-op">Charity Place - IT Support Co-op</h4>
<p><em>October 2021 - February 2022</em></p>
<p>An entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory &amp; Google Admin
<ul>
<li>Resetting passwords, adding and removing users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBTS
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly</li>
<li>Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meraki
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Resetting &amp; setting up mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
<ul>
<li>A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="university-of-cincinnati-early-it-summer-camp---teaching-assistant-intern">University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern</h4>
<p><em>June 2020</em></p>
<p>I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
<h4 id="cpr-cell-phone-repair---repair-technician">CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician</h4>
<p><em>November 2018 - May 2019</em></p>
<p>An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I&rsquo;d just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training. I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing half the time. The cherry on top was getting paid minimum wage. Never again.</p>

<h2 id="interests--goals">Interests &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d say I am currently interested in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Administration
<ul>
<li>Entra ID</li>
<li>Intune</li>
<li>Domain Controllers and Servers</li>
<li>Google Admin</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Networking &amp; Infrastructure</li>
<li>Cloud Computing
<ul>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>Azure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtualization
<ul>
<li>ESXi</li>
<li>Proxmox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Web Dev / Scripting
<ul>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Bash</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I am not interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>I hate these with an absolute passion and want nothing to do with them. Although I am open to making exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Security
<ul>
<li>Obviously you need to aware of best security practices at all times, but I am not too interested in really specializing in cybersecurity. From what I can tell a lot of cybersecurity is just creating and implementing policies. It is also hyper competitive and can be the first department to be laid off if a company is struggling. I would rather have a role that is more focused on development and project creation, rather than playing detective all day, patching holes, and writing policies. <br />
There are obviously exceptions, but from what I can tell, most security jobs seem underwhelming and not too exciting to me.</li>
</ul>
