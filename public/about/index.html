<h2 id="previous-it-experience">Previous IT Experience:</h2>
<h4 id="catholic-charities-southwestern-ohio---it-supppot-co-op">Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Supppot Co-op</h4>
<p><em>October 2021 - February 2022</em></p>
<p>This was my first true IT job. This was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory &amp; Google Admin
<ul>
<li>Resetting passwords, adding and removing users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBTS
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly</li>
<li>Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meraki
<ul>
<li>Configuring accounts</li>
<li>Resetting &amp; setting up mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
<ul>
<li>A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="university-of-cincinnati-early-it-summer-camp---teaching-assistant-intern">University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern</h4>
<p><em>June 2020</em></p>
<p>I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
<h4 id="cpr-cell-phone-repair---repair-technician">CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician</h4>
<p><em>November 2018 - May 2019</em></p>
<p>An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I&rsquo;d just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not only was it easy to mess up the repair, but this was also someone else&rsquo;s phone I was repairing. So, if anything went wrong I&rsquo;d have to let them know and then deal with an angry customer and boss. Luckily that only ever happened once.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>I will say I am extremely interested cybersecurity / infosec / whatever you want to call it. Specically pen testing. I really want to start competing in CTF&rsquo;s and start working my way up to becoming an ethical hacker. Obviously this isn&rsquo;t easy in any way. This would obviously be way easier if I&rsquo;d gone for a CS / SE degree. I&rsquo;m not that interested in math and theory though so I still think I made the right choice, it&rsquo;ll just be more of an up hill journey.</p>
