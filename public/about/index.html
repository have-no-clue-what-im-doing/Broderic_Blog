<h4 id="university-of-cincinnati-early-it-summer-camp---teaching-assistant-intern">University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern</h4>
<p><em>June 2020</em></p>
<p>I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
<h4 id="cpr-cell-phone-repair---repair-technician">CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician</h4>
<p><em>November 2018 - May 2019</em></p>
<p>An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I&rsquo;d just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training. I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing half the time. The cherry on top was getting paid minimum wage. Never again.</p>

<h2 id="interests--goals">Interests &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d say I am currently interested in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Administration
<ul>
<li>Entra ID</li>
<li>Intune</li>
<li>Domain Controllers and Servers</li>
<li>Google Admin</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cybersecurity
<ul>
<li>NetSec</li>
<li>Infrastructure Security</li>
<li>Web Application Security</li>
<li>Reverse Malware Engineer</li>
<li>DevOpsSec</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Networking &amp; Infrastructure</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Cloud Computing
<ul>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>Azure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtualization
<ul>
<li>ESXi (RIP, thanks Broadcom)</li>
<li>Proxmox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Web Dev / Scripting
<ul>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Digital Forensics</li>
</ul>
<p>What I am not interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>I hate these things with an absolute passion and want nothing to do with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say my current cert path is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security+ (2-4 weeks)</li>
<li>CCNA (6-8 months)</li>
<li>AWS-CCP (3-5 weeks)</li>
<li>Azure Fundamentals (3-5 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>The order isn&rsquo;t really set in stone. I do know I want to get the Security+ immediately after I graduate. Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard of an exam to pass. I more open to whatever cert I think will help with my current job, or a job I want in the future.</p>
