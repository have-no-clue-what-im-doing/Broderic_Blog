      <description>Something I was just thinking about recently was our history of phones and how we used to all have a &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; phone. You know, just a phone that sits at home all day. A landline. Just about every home in America had one. Then suddenly cellphones came along, they got cheaper and cheaper until everyone had a flip phone in their pocket. And then one day, we each decided that there was no point in paying for a landline when we all had cell phones.</description>
