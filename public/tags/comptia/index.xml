      <description>So I just recently passed the glorified vocab test known as the Security+. Just wanted to give me thoughts about. I took about 2 weeks of studying, although I was sick for 4 days. So it was really about a week and a half. I do have a degree in cybersecurity, as well as having already taken and passed the Network+ 3 years prior. So that definitely helped.
I had planned on taking the Security+ much earlier, but once I got a fulltime job whilst still taking classes fulltime, I held off on it.</description>
