      <description>According to this article from CNBC, Apple will be changing how AirDrop works.
Originally, AirDrop had three options:
Receiving off Contacts Only Everyone Having the third option selected is pretty self explanatory, it allowed you to received messages from anyone.
But now they&amp;rsquo;re going to be changing that third option to &amp;ldquo;Everyone (For 10 Minutes)&amp;rdquo; This means that AirDrop will be enabled to receive messages from anyone for only 10 minutes at a time.</description>
