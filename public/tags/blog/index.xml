      <description>Quick announcement here. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the domain to this blog to: broderic.blog
The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course Squarespace had to ruin that. I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year. Domain dealers are lame though, they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a great deal when purchasing a new domain, but of course once it comes to renewal they will screw you over by jacking up the renewal price.</description>
