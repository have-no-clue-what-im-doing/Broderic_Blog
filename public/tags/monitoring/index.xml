      <description>A couple days ago I was mindlessly browsing the web when suddenly my internet went out. With it being 1am, it was a clear sign for me to go to bed, but I ignored it and just hopped on my phone for a bit. 30 minutes later I noticed the internet was still out and I was kinda pissed. (As if I was doing anything actually important.) Usually these outages only last about 10-15 minutes or so.</description>
