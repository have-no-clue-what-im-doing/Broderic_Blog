      <description>Short answer: Voter registration is public information.
Long answer:
In a world where it&amp;rsquo;s already far too easy to dox someone, public voter registration makes it 10x easier. Yeah, I seriously did not know that my registration would become public, otherwise I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even bothered registering. You can visit this site to see each state&amp;rsquo;s laws on what information is kept public and what is kept confidential.
What&amp;rsquo;s even more funny is that you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to go out and download those zip and tar files.</description>
