      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently persuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. The second being I want to document any projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.</description>
