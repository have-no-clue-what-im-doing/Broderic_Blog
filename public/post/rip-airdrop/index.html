<article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"> RIP AirDrop </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/apple-limited-a-crucial-airdrop-function-in-china-just-weeks-before-protests.html" target="_blank">this</a> article from CNBC, Apple will be changing how AirDrop works.</p>
<p>Originally, AirDrop had three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receiving off</li>
<li>Contacts Only</li>
<li>Everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>Having the third option selected is pretty self explanatory, it allowed you to received messages from anyone.</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;re going to be changing that third option to &ldquo;Everyone (For 10 Minutes)&rdquo; This means that AirDrop will be enabled to receive messages from anyone for only 10 minutes at a time. Once 10 minute s is up you&rsquo;ll have to manually re-enable it. This is fucking stupid and takes away the greatest and most fun feature of AirDrop, the ability to AirDrop with strangers. Now if you want to AirDrop with strangers you first have to coordinate it with them, which defeats the whole purpose. AirDropping should be a spontaneous experience, who the hell is going to use AirDrop with strangers if they constantly have to manually enable it?</p>
<p>Apple is planning on having the AirDrop change implemented within a year, with China already receiving the update. According to the article it&rsquo;s most likely because the CCP isn&rsquo;t the biggest fans of citizens having the ability to communicate with each other without it being monitored by the government. This shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone that Apple would change something like this just to please the CCP. You think Apple is going to suddenly going to say no and lose out on billions and billions of dollars? They&rsquo;ll start saying no once they have nothing to lose. Which will probably never happen.</p>
<p>Honestly, now what am I supposed to do to entertain myself while waiting in line, or waiting for class to start? I AirDropped people while waiting in line for the pharmacy, groceries, a doctor&rsquo;s appointment, the list goes on. Any idle time when I am surrounded by strangers was a time to pull out AirDrop and see what would be accepted. Now those times are coming to an end.</p>
<p>I want to end this little post by commemorating my best AirDrops.</p>

<p>Those are just a few examples of some AirDrops from recent memory.<br>
Here&rsquo;s a couple that I received myself in response. I have yet to receive an unsolicited AirDrop.</p>

<strong>Reaction:</strong> Beautiful</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got plenty more but it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass looking for these. I refuse to waste anymore time on this.</p>
<p>Rest in peace AirDrop. There will never be anything like you again. And fuck Apple.</p>
