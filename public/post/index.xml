      <description>Quick announcement here. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the domain to this blog to: broderic.blog
The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course Squarespace had to ruin that. I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year. Domain dealers are lame though, they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a great deal when purchasing a new domain, but of course once it comes to renewal they will screw you over by jacking up the renewal price.</description>

      <description>A couple days ago I was mindlessly browsing the web when suddenly my internet went out. With it being 1am, it was a clear sign for me to go to bed, but I ignored it and just hopped on my phone for a bit. 30 minutes later I noticed the internet was still out and I was kinda pissed. (As if I was doing anything actually important.) Usually these outages only last about 10-15 minutes or so.</description>

      <title>When we had both landlines and cellphones</title>

      <description>Something I was just thinking about recently was our history of phones and how we used to all have a &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; phone. You know, just a phone that sits at home all day. A landline. Just about every home in America had one. Then suddenly cellphones came along, they got cheaper and cheaper until everyone had a flip phone in their pocket. And then one day, we each decided that there was no point in paying for a landline when we all had cell phones.</description>

      <description>For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to print from my iPhone to the Dell printer in my parent&amp;rsquo;s house. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure when we got the printer but I know it&amp;rsquo;s at least been like 7+ years. The printer in question is the Dell 2155cn Color MFP. According to the copyright on the user guide, the printer was released in 2010. That makes the printer a decade+ old.</description>

      <description>So before I began this project, it was clear that the network closet was a mess:
Wires and cables everywhere. The patch panel is unorganized. There&amp;rsquo;s so much crap everywhere you can&amp;rsquo;t even tell what&amp;rsquo;s going on. I do want to say that most of this was not me. This was the previous owner. When we moved into the house the previous owner had already wired every inch of it with cat5e and coaxial.</description>

      <description>I originally found out about Hugo after browsing Hacker News (YCombinator) and coming across a blog with a footer containing a link to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s site. You can scroll to the bottom to get an exact example of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. If you click on the link you can see Hugo advertised as: &amp;ldquo;One of the most popular open-source static site generators.&amp;rdquo; Beforehand, I had been thinking about creating my own site and was researching what exactly I wanted to build my site with.</description>
