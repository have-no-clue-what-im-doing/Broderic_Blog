In a world where it&rsquo;s already far too easy to dox someone, public voter registration makes it 10x easier.

    <h1 class="title"> Why I&#39;m Cancelling My Voter Registration  </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Short answer: Voter registration is public information.</p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<p>In a world where it&rsquo;s already far too easy to dox someone, public voter registration makes it 10x easier. Yeah, I seriously did not know that my registration would become public, otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have even bothered registering. You can visit this <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/access-to-and-use-of-voter-registration-lists.aspx" target="_blank">site</a> to see each state&rsquo;s laws on what information is kept public and what is kept confidential.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more funny is that you don&rsquo;t even have to go out and download those zip and tar files. There&rsquo;s already websites created that make it super easy to search up a name and find an address. Take this <a href="https://www.ohioresidentdatabase.com/" target="_blank">site</a> as an example. There&rsquo;s many of these sites for each state. This is the real danger since the average person doesn&rsquo;t even know how to extract a zip/tar file.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, some of these bastards decided to require a fee to access the data. Most go for around $20 per request, but <a href="https://voteinfo.utah.gov/obtain-voter-registration-or-election-data/" target="_blank">freakin Utah&rsquo;s is a whopping $1,050!!!!</a> Wtf Utah??? So not only are they publishing all this data, but some states also put it behind a paywall and profit off of it.</p>
<p>The two main reasons why having voter registration public info is a terrible idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It makes doxxing and stalking a million times easier. Usually it takes a bit of digging to find personal info on someone. (Okay, not that much digging) But having a database with your personal info in it, paid for by your tax dollars, is bullshit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now every little dipshit running for office can just get their little minions to start spamming my mailbox with their stupid junk mail. And then their minions do a little bit more work and start spamming my number and email. (I know that neither of those are not included in any voter database, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to put two and two together.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After doing a bit more research I realized that it was already too late. Some states keep a permanent record and will just change my status as a voter to inactive. So I&rsquo;ll still be on the list with my name and address on there. Although I&rsquo;ll soon be changing addresses soon, so not the biggest deal.</p>
<p>Also another reason I&rsquo;m cancelling my registration, I kinda don&rsquo;t give a shit about politics anymore. I know this is pretty common for young people, but like I&rsquo;m becoming more and more apolitical by the day. I have better things to spend my time on than keeping up with dumbass American politics. Ignorance is bliss, and taking about 30 minutes to hour each month to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on in world seems to be working perfectly fine with me. Believe it or not, you don&rsquo;t suddenly turn into an ignorant dumbass when you stop watching the news. Like unless you&rsquo;re on some political debate team, 10 to 15 minutes a week seems to work perfectly fine.</p>
