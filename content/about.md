Hi I'm Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers. 

I'm currently pursuing a double major in IT and Cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. And the second being I want to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

## IT Experience:

#### Current Job - IT Support Specialist for a warehouse of 200+ people

*July 2022 - Present*

I currently work for a warehouse that operates as the number one seller on Amazon. I help manage, maintain, and troubleshoot over 100 printers and computers.

After a year of working here I am no longer afraid of the scissor lift! 


#### Charity Place - IT Support Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

An entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices 
* Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
	* A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required

#### University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern

*June 2020*

I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it's pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

#### CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician

*November 2018 - May 2019*

An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I'd just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training. I honestly didn't know what I was doing half the time. The cherry on top was getting paid minimum wage. Never again.

## Interests & Goals

I'd say I am currently interested in the following areas:

* System Administration
	* Entra ID
	* Intune
	* Domain Controllers and Servers
	* Google Admin
	* Linux
* Networking & Infrastructure
* Cloud Computing
	* AWS
	* Azure
* Virtualization
	* ESXi
	* Proxmox
* Web Dev / Scripting
	* ReactJS
	* Python
	* Javascript
	* Bash

What I am not interested in:
* Printers
	* I hate these with an absolute passion and want nothing to do with them. Although I am open to making exceptions. 
* Security
	* Obviously you need to aware of best security practices at all times, but I am not too interested in really specializing in cybersecurity. From what I can tell a lot of cybersecurity is just creating and implementing policies. It is also hyper competitive and can be the first department to be laid off if a company is struggling. I would rather have a role that is more focused on development and project creation, rather than playing detective all day, patching holes, and writing policies. {{< line_break >}}
	There are obviously exceptions, but from what I can tell, most security jobs seem underwhelming and not too exciting to me.
