Hi I'm Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers. 

I'm currently persuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. The second being I want to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

## Previous IT Experience:

#### Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Supppot Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

This was my first true IT job. This was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices 
* Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
	* A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required

#### University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern

*June 2020*

I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it's pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

#### CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician

*November 2018 - May 2019*

An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I'd just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not only was it easy to mess up the repair, but this was also someone else's phone I was repairing. So, if anything went wrong I'd have to let them know and then deal with an angry customer and boss. Luckily that only ever happened once.

## Interests 

I will say I am extremely interested cybersecurity / infosec / whatever you want to call it. Specically pen testing. I really want to start competing in CTF's and start working my way up to becoming an ethical hacker. Obviously this isn't easy in any way. This would obviously be way easier if I'd gone for a CS / SE degree. I'm not that interested in math and theory though so I still think I made the right choice, it'll just be more of an up hill journey.
