Hi, I'm Broderic. Born in the 20th centurary; participating in the 21st. As of right now I attend the University of Cincinnati and am pursuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. The second being I want to also to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

## Previous IT Experience:

#### Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Supppot Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

This was my first true IT job. This was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices
