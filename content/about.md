Hi I'm Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers. 

I'm currently persuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. The second being I want to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

## Previous IT Experience:

#### Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio - IT Supppot Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

This was my first true IT job. This was an entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices 
* Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
	* A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required

#### University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern

*June 2020*

I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it's pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

#### CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician

*November 2018 - May 2019*

An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I'd just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not only was it easy to mess up the repair, but this was also someone else's phone I was repairing. So, if anything went wrong I'd have to let them know and then deal with an angry customer and boss. Luckily that only ever happened once.

## Interests & Goals


My top interest is defintley cybersecurity. Specifically pentesting. I want to start competing in CTF's and start working my way to becoming a professoinal pentester. Obviously this isn't easy in any way. This would be way easier if I'd gone for a CS / SE degree. I'm not the most interested in math and theory though so I still think I made the right choice, it'll just be more of an up hill journey. And yes, I am aware there can be a lot of math involved in hacking, just depends on what you're hacking. Another issue I have is that I'm not really much of a programmer right now. I will say I am familar with the fundamentals of programming. Functions, variables, booleans, if else statements, loops, etc. I have expereince using Python, Bash, and Powershell. Certainly not enough though, and that is something I need to work on. Once I have a better understanding of scripting lanuages I'll start working my way toward lower level progamming languages like C and C++. The problem with all of this though is that it will take time. Like a lot of time. I can't just graduate with an IT degree and come out with a pentesting job. 

I've decided probably the best and most practical way of doing this is to just work as a SysAdmin / Security Analyst / Network Egineer / Whatever and just studying all of this on the side. I think the best way to study is with CTF's and certs and just programming in general. My plan is to obtain the following certs in this order within the next 5 years:

* Security+
* Linux+
* CYSA+
* Pentest+
* OSCP

About to start studying for the Security+ Should take me about a month to complete. I already have a decent amount of expereince with linux, use it for a lot of IT classes, but I want to really have an in-depth understanding of it. Think Linux+ should probably take me 2-3 months. I've read the CYSA+ is pretty difficult. Think it'd probably take me 4-8 months. Want to take this before the Pentest+ as I've read it makes taking the Pentest+ much easier. Pentest+ will probably take another 4-8 months. I believe after passing all four of those certs, it'll make studying for the OSCP a little bit easier.
